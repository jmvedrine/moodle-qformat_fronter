#Fronter XML question import format

This is the first version of a Moodle plugin to import question made in the Fronter LMS and exported as an XML file.
##Installation
You must install this plugin in the question/format/ subdirectory of your Moodle server, in a subfolder with "fronter" as name.

You must visit Site administration and install it like any other Moodle plugin.

It will then add a new choice when you import questions in the question bank.

This work was made possible by comments, ideas and test files provided by Moodle users on the Moodle quiz forum:

It also uses some of the previous work made by Richard Rode (richard.rode@univie.ac.at) to write an import format for Moodle 1.9.
