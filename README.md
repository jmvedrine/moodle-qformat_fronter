Fronter XML question import format
==================================

This is the first version of a Moodle plugin to import question made in the Fronter LMS and exported as an XML file.

## Installation

To install, either download the zip file, unzip it, and place it in the moodle/question/format directory. (You will need to rename the directory from "moodle-qformat_fronter" to just "fronter".)

Alternatively, get the code using git by running the following command in the top level folder of your Moodle install:

git clone git://github.com/jmvedrine/moodle-qformat_fronter.git question/format/fronter

You must visit Site administration and install it like any other Moodle plugin.

It will then add a new choice when you import questions in the question bank.

## Support

Please report bugs and improvements ideas using this forum thread:

This work was made possible by comments, ideas and test files provided by Moodle users on the Moodle quiz forum:
https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=737
It also uses some of the previous work made by Richard Rode (richard.rode@univie.ac.at) to write an import format for Moodle 1.9.
